# Path Configuration Template
# =============================================================================
# This file defines base paths that are used across all config files.
# To customize for your machine:
#   1. Copy this file to `configs/paths_local.yaml`
#   2. Modify the paths in paths_local.yaml to match your setup
#   3. paths_local.yaml is gitignored and won't be committed
#
# The paths_local.yaml will be automatically loaded and merged.
# If paths_local.yaml doesn't exist, these defaults will be used.
# =============================================================================

paths:
  # ===== Data Directories =====
  # Root directory for training data (MegaDepth, ScanNet, etc.)
  #
  # By default we assume datasets live under the repo-local `data/` folder.
  # For real training runs, create `configs/paths_local.yaml` and override these
  # paths to point at your dataset storage.
  DATA_ROOT: "data"

  # Alternative data root (some datasets may be on different storage)
  DATA_ROOT_ALT: "${paths.DATA_ROOT}"

  # MegaDepth dataset indices
  MEGADEPTH_INDEX_ROOT: "${paths.DATA_ROOT}/megadepth/indexs/megadepth_indices"

  # ScanNet dataset root
  SCANNET_ROOT: "${paths.DATA_ROOT}/scannet_plus"

  # Video datasets root (for flyingthings, kubrics, pointodyssey, etc.)
  VIDEO_DATA_ROOT: "${paths.DATA_ROOT}"

  # ===== Evaluation / Inference Data =====
  # Keep evaluation inputs separate from training inputs to avoid accidental coupling.
  # By default, evaluation reads from the same `data/` tree.
  EVAL_DATA_ROOT: "${paths.DATA_ROOT}"

  # TAP-Vid root. Expected layout (examples):
  # - ${paths.TAPVID_ROOT}/tapvid_davis/tapvid_davis.pkl
  # - ${paths.TAPVID_ROOT}/tapvid_robotap/robotap_split*.pkl
  # - ${paths.TAPVID_ROOT}/rgb_stacking/tapvid_rgb_stacking/tapvid_rgb_stacking.pkl
  #
  # For open-source / smoke tests, we ship a tiny TAP-Vid DAVIS subset under:
  #   data/tapvid_local/tapvid_davis/tapvid_davis.pkl
  #
  # For the full TAP-Vid datasets, override this in `configs/paths_local.yaml` to point at
  # your dataset storage.
  TAPVID_ROOT: "${paths.EVAL_DATA_ROOT}/tapvid_local"

  # ===== Model Weights =====
  # Directory containing pretrained model weights
  WEIGHTS_ROOT: "weights"

  # DINOv3 weights path
  #
  # By default we point at a local file under `weights/` so runs can be fully offline
  # (assuming you have placed/downloaded the weights there).
  # Set this to null if you want torch.hub to download weights automatically.
  DINOV3_WEIGHTS: "${paths.WEIGHTS_ROOT}/dinov3_vitl16_pretrain_lvd1689m-8aa4cbdd.pth"

  # DINOv3 local repo (for torch.hub)
  # Set to local path if using offline mode, otherwise use 'auto' to download from github.
  # Example (auto download):
  #   DINOV3_WEIGHTS: null
  #   DINOV3_REPO: "auto"
  DINOV3_REPO: "auto"

  # Pretrained ReTracker checkpoint (null to train from scratch)
  PRETRAINED_CKPT: null

  # ===== Output Directories =====
  # Training outputs (checkpoints, logs)
  OUTPUTS_ROOT: "./outputs"

  # Optional convenience paths (keep train/eval separate).
  TRAIN_OUTPUTS_ROOT: "${paths.OUTPUTS_ROOT}/training"
  EVAL_OUTPUTS_ROOT: "${paths.OUTPUTS_ROOT}/eval"
