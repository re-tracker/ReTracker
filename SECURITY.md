# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the latest release and the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues responsibly. We prefer private disclosure:

1) **GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)**  
   Use the repository's "Report a vulnerability" flow to open a private
   advisory.

2) **Fallback**  
   If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, open a GitHub issue with the
   label `security` and tag `@re-tracker`. Avoid including sensitive details in
   the public issue; we will follow up to move the discussion to a private
   channel.

## Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgement**: within 72 hours
- **Triage**: within 7 days
- **Fix or mitigation**: as soon as practical, with coordinated disclosure

If you have a strict disclosure timeline, please note it in your report.
