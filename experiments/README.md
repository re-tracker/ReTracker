# Experiments

This folder contains optional research/benchmark code that is **not** required for
the core `retracker/` library.

- `experiments/benchmark/`: multi-method tracking benchmark (ReTracker vs. third-party trackers)
- `experiments/evaluation/`: detailed notes for running evaluation on public benchmarks
- `experiments/tools/`: local experiment utilities (gitignored; keep personal scripts here)
- `experiments/third_party/`: third-party repositories cloned on demand (not committed to git)
