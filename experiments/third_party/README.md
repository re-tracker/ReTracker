# experiments/third_party

This directory is intentionally empty in git.

`experiments/benchmark` can optionally clone third-party tracker repositories here
so the benchmark runner can import/run them.

Default layout (created by `experiments/benchmark/scripts/install_third_party.sh`):

- `experiments/third_party/track_on/` (Track-On2)
- `experiments/third_party/co-tracker/` (CoTracker3)
- `experiments/third_party/tapnet/` (TapNet/TAPIR)
