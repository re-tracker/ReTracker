# Governance

ReTracker is maintained by a small core maintainer group listed in
`MAINTAINERS.md`. The project aims to keep decision-making lightweight and
transparent.

## Decision Making

- **Routine changes**: reviewed and merged by a maintainer.
- **Substantial changes** (APIs, training/eval pipelines, or breaking changes):
  require a design discussion in an issue or PR before implementation.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Active contributors who consistently improve the project and help review issues
and pull requests may be invited to join as maintainers. The current maintainers
decide by consensus.
